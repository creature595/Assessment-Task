# Assessment-Task
**Idea**
My idea is a moodboard photography sharing website where users can post, like, and potentially comment on other peoples' photos.
Within the website, there will be the option to book tickets to photography exhibitions or other events.

*Funtional Aspects*
- Ease of navigtation
- Images
- Search bar
- Fast loading speed
- Security
- Blog

*Non-functional*

- Heart icon lighting up when user likes a post
  
## Week 2
This week I created simple wireframes that show what pages would look like. I made one for main pages.

## Week 3
This week, I designed what I want my homepage to look like. I experimented with colour and typography and chose the ones that I liked.
*This a draft design for the home page*

## Week 4
This week, I worked on creating algorithms and test cases for the login page.

Steps of the algorithm:
1. User will start at the login page
2. If user already had an existing account, user will start typing in username and password.
3. If user doesn't have an existing account, user can choose to create a new account
4. If user chose to create a new account, user will input their desired username and password then confirm and will be redirected to login page
5. If user already has an exisitng accound and details are wrong, user will be required to retype details
6. If user already has an exisitng accound and details are right, user will proceed onto website.

# Assessment-Task
**Idea**
My idea is a moodboard photography sharing website where users can post, like, and potentially comment on other peoples' photos.
Within the website, there will be the option to book tickets to photography exhibitions or other events.

*Funtional Aspects*

- Fast loading speed
- Security
- Blog

*Non-functional*

- Heart icon lighting up when user likes a post
